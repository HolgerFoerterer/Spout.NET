# Spout.NET

Spout.NET is a C# .NET Implementation for [Spout2](https://github.com/leadedge/Spout2), A video frame sharing system for Windows.

## Usage

The API of this mapping library is **completely consistent** with the Spout SDK, so you can refer to the [Spout SDK Documentation](https://github.com/leadedge/Spout2/blob/2.006/SpoutSDK/Documentation/SpoutSDK.pdf) for development. You can use Marshal Class to avoid unsafe code.
